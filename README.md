# Find the Puppy
Overview

Find the Dog game brings a love of dogs with the fun of a classic game of chance. The player and the computer opponent try and find the matching dog card out of an array of 3 cards that are randomly positioned on the gameboard. If the player chooses the correct card they win. If the player chooses the wrong card the computer takes a turn. If the computer chooses the correct card, the computer wins. If both the player and computer do not choose the right card, it is a draw. 
This game utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
